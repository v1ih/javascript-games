# javascript-games
(all games i've created to learn javascript right here)

Hello! Welcome to mmy account and my repository. I am Lav√≠nia, also known as V1ih.

I created this hoping that it'd help people around here to get ideas and enjoy my content.
I have a really hard time learning programming in a normal way, learning meanings, all the things step by step, so for me, it's really boring to learn in a normal way. To fix that I have found many tutorials on youtube that helps you learn any programming language by creating applications or games. It is more fun this way, trust me. 

Anyway, I hope you enjoy this.

Bye.
